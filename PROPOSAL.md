# Proposal: TEE/HSM Secure Wallet Integration for SpoonOS

## Problem Description

- AI agents handling blockchain operations expose private keys to potential security breaches and unauthorized access
- Current SpoonOS agents lack hardware-secured key management, creating vulnerability in autonomous financial operations
- Enterprise users require auditable and compliant key management solutions for institutional blockchain automation
- Manual transaction signing prevents full automation of DeFi strategies and autonomous agent operations
- Existing wallet solutions don't integrate with AI agent frameworks, limiting secure autonomous capabilities
- Severity: Critical - Private key exposure in AI systems poses existential risk to user funds and institutional adoption
- Lack of policy-based transaction controls creates regulatory compliance challenges for enterprise deployments

## Business Opportunity

- Target customers: DeFi users seeking AI automation, enterprise blockchain applications, institutional crypto users, autonomous trading bot developers
- Market size: Hardware security module market valued at $1.2 billion with 12% annual growth, DeFi automation market exceeding $100 billion
- Potential business models:
  - Enterprise licensing for institutional SpoonOS deployments ($10,000-50,000 per year)
  - SaaS model for secure agent hosting ($50-500 per month per agent)
  - Hardware security integration partnerships (revenue sharing with HSM vendors)
  - Compliance-as-a-Service for regulated financial institutions ($25,000-100,000 per implementation)
- Estimated development cost: $200,000-300,000 for production-ready TEE/HSM integration
- Competitive advantage: First-to-market hardware-secured AI agent framework with enterprise-grade compliance features

## Technical Plan

- Solution Approach: Integrate Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and Hardware Security Module (HSM) support into SpoonOS for secure private key management
- Unique aspects:
  - Hardware-protected private key storage using Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, or dedicated HSMs
  - Policy-based signing engine with configurable transaction limits and approval workflows
  - Complete audit trail with immutable logging of all cryptographic operations
  - Emergency controls and multi-signature support for high-value transactions
  - Native SpoonOS agent integration with secure tool interfaces
- SpoonOS Technologies: SpoonOS Core Agent Framework, SpoonOS Security Module, SpoonOS Tool Registry, SpoonOS Monitoring System
- Technology decisions:
  - Intel SGX SDK for TEE implementation on compatible hardware
  - PKCS#11 interface for HSM integration (YubiHSM, AWS CloudHSM, Azure Dedicated HSM)
  - secp256k1 and ed25519 cryptographic primitives for blockchain compatibility
  - SQLite for policy storage with encryption at rest
  - Prometheus metrics for security monitoring and alerting
- Implementation complexity: High - Requires deep integration with hardware security features and extensive security testing
